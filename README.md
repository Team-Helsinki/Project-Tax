**All You should do to test it is go to connection.php, that can be found in the includes folder. change the parameters to suit your own database**

in my own database i had a table called 'profile' with 8 rows <br>

id - int(11), primary key, auto incremental and null = no<br>
tin - varchar(225) and null = no<br>
name -varchar(225) and null = no<br>
phone - varchar(225) and null = no<br>
email -varchar(225) and null = no<br>
address - text and null = yes<br>
status -varchar(225) and null = yes<br>
